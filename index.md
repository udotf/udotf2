#My site!

Good Morning,

I just want to make a site where I can check my coding progress as well as have an outlet to express my thoughts and opinions.

If you found this site congrats.

There isin't much here.



Yet.


Give it time though. I am learning and building my skills little by little. 


Thank you,

UDOTF2.



So an interesting thing I learned receintly.

I work from a laptop to a citrix workspace. I learned that I can use RDP to access the workspace and no longer need to go through 3 sites of authentication any more. Yay
